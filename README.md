# connect-four-game
I have developed a Connect Four game using React.js that provides players with the option to play against a computer or other human opponents. The game features three difficulty levels—easy, medium, and hard—each with a 30-second time limit for making moves. Additionally, players can choose to restart, quit, or continue the game.
